Catching is not always easy. Monsters can break out of traps if they are strong or your trap is weak. Make sure to stock up on powerful traps to capture your favorite rare Monsters.

## FAQ

#### How do I catch monsters?

Use the slash (/) command `/catch` to start the catch event. Use an owned trap by clicking the buttons seen below the catch emded. You will be notified if your trap was successful in catching the Monster. If you don't act fast enough, the Monster will escape.

#### What are "Shmoins"?

- Shmoins are the currency you use to purchase items from the shop.
- To earn Shmoins, catch Monsters. The better the rarity of Monster, the better the Shmoin payout is.
